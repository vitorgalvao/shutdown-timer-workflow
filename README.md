Configure the timer in the [Workflow’s Configuration](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/user-configuration/). You can also set apps to close before shutdown, so they do not reopen on next login.

To trigger an immediate shutdown or restart, use the respective keywords (defaults: `shutdown`, `restart`).
